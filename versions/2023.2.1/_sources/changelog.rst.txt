`2023.2.0 <https://github.com/openbiosim/biosimspace/compare/2023.1.2...2023.2.0>`_ - Mar 30 2023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Make sure that system properties are preserved when creating a new Sire system.
* Fixed an issue with the OpenMM minimisation protocol that meant that the number of steps was ignored (`#12 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/12>`__).
* Use native Sire PDB downloading functionality to remove ``pypdb`` dependency.
* Fixed an issue with SMILES characters in molecule names causing issues for ``gmx grompp`` (`#14 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/14>`__).
* Increase default SOMD cut-off since it uses reaction field (`#15 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/15>`__).
* No longer downcast molecules to single residues and atoms when searching (`#19 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/19>`__).
* Remove velocities when combining molecules if the property isn't present for all molecules (`#21 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/21>`__).
* Set default-valued properties when merging molecules to avoid issues with zero values when units are stripped (`#24 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/24>`__).
* Remove ``watchdog`` to avoid non-deterministic parsing of AMBER output (`#27 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/27>`__).

* Allow keyword arguments to be passed through to ``lomap`` in :func:`generateNetwork <BioSimSpace.Align.generateNetwork>` (`#29 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/29>`__).
* Add mixin classes to allow position restraints to be used with a wider range of protocols (`@xiki-tempula <https://github.com/xiki-tempula>`_) and alchemical simulations for non-production protocols (`@msuruzhon <https://github.com/msuruzhon>`_). Switch to using ``gmx energy`` to parse GROMACS energy records (`@xiki-tempula <https://github.com/xiki-tempula>`_) (`#30 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/30>`__).
* Switch to using native RDKit conversion throughout to avoid conversion via an intermediate file format.
* Expose Sire to OpenMM conversion functionality in :mod:`BioSimSpace.Convert <BioSimSpace.Convert>`.
* Added Python 3.10 support and now build Python 3.10 packages. This is now the default version of Python for BioSimSpace, and the version we recommend for new workflows. Note that we will drop automatic building of Python 3.8 packages later this year (likely Q3 or Q4). This will be timed to co-incide with when we add Python 3.11 support, and when (we anticipate) conda-forge will drop Python 3.8. Our aim is to only build packages for a maximum of 3 Python versions at a time.

`2023.1.2 <https://github.com/openbiosim/biosimspace/compare/2023.1.1...2023.1.2>`_ - Feb 24 2023
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Refactor code to use a unified :class:`WorkDir <BioSimSpace._Utils.WorkDir>` class to simplify the creation of working directories (`#2 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/2>`__).
* Added :meth:`isSame <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.System.isSame>` method to compare systems using a sub-set of system and molecular properties. This improves our file caching support, allowing a user to exclude properties when comparing cached systems prior to write, e.g. ignoring coordinates and velocities, if those are the only things that differ between the systems `(#3 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/3>`__).
* Added the initial version of :mod:`BioSimSpace.Convert <BioSimSpace.Convert>`, which provides support for converting between native `BioSimSpace`, `Sire <http://sire.openbiosim.org>`__, and `RDKit <https://www.rdkit.org>`__ objects (`#9 <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/biosimspace/pull/9>`__).
* Fixed several formatting issues with the website documentation.

* Wrapped the new `sire.load <https://sire.openbiosim.org/api/sire.html#sire.load>`__ function to allow loading of URLs.
* Add basic file caching support to avoid re-writing files for the same molecular system.
* Added :data:`BioSimSpace._Config` sub-package to simplify the generation of configuration files for molecular dynamics engines and improve flexiblity. (Adapted from code written by `@msuruzhon <https://github.com/msuruzhon>`_.)
* Deprecated ``BioSimSpace.IO.glob`` since globbing is now performed automatically.
* Autoformat entire codebase using `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__.
* Fix issues following Sire 2023 API updates.
* Update documentation for new OpenBioSim website.
