# BioSimSpace Website

This repo is used to build and host the BioSimSpace website.

It builds a versioned sphinx website using the scripts in `actions`, assuming
that BioSimSpace has sphinx docs set up in `BioSimSpace/doc`.

This is heavily based on the [metawards](https://metawards.org) versioned website pipeline.
